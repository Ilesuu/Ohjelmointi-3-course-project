# Project information
This is a university project I did for the programming 3 course. It is a game about trying to steal energy from the buses of tampere in a ufo while evading the chasing fighter jet.

Please note that this repository is for code demonstration purposes only, it will not run because it is lacking the courseside code library.
This was a group project, so not all of the code is mine: I worked mainly on the Player, Chaser, City, GameWindow and Unittest classes. For a more exact work breakdown, refer to commit history or loppudokumentti.pdf


# How to play the game

1. First Run the program
2. A dialog window will open with the cover art of the game and text explaining the objective of the game 
3. Press the "Rules" button to open the game rules
4. Select "Two Player" if you want to play against a friend (local multiplayer) otherwise an AI will control the enemy plane
5. Press "Start Game" to start the game
6. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the spaceship. Collect enegy from buses by hovering on top of them. Avoid the Finnish defence forces hornet
7. The game ends if the plane catches you or you run out of energy. 
9. Try to survive for as long as you can! Good luck!

10. (if Two player option has been selected, the plane can be controlled with the WASD keys.) Try to catch the ufo!
